# Tokenizer

Tokenizer is a simple PHP library for creating and validating token-based encryption.


## Description

It is a simple and secure way to encrypt data generating small tokens that can be used as a parameter. It is useful for creating URLs with encrypted data, such as password reset links, email verification links, and more.


## Installation

Tokenizer is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/ae8/tokenizer), and installation via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is the recommended way to install Tokenizer. Just add this line to your `composer.json` file:

```json
"ae8/tokenizer": "^1.6"
```

or run

```sh
composer require ae8/tokenizer
```

Note that the `vendor` folder and the `vendor/autoload.php` script are generated by Composer; they are not part of Tokenizer.

## Usage

```php
use AE8\Tokenizer\Tokenizer;

// Encrypt a value
$encrypted = Tokenizer::criptografar('Tokenizer');

// Decrypt a value
$decrypted = Tokenizer::descriptografar($encrypted);

echo $encrypted . PHP_EOL;
echo $decrypted . PHP_EOL;
```
